By Dileep Ramachandrarao Krishna Murthy and Steffen Lohmann, 2018-02-14


## Technical achievements w.r.t WP3 objectives and tasks

Fraunhofer IAIS has mainly worked on T3.3 and T3.4 of the VISUALIZATION & INTERACTION for RAPID ASSESSMENT TOOLS (WP3):
* T3.3 Visual model building tool support 
  * obtain generic library from the DSL prototyping activities (WP4), which contains the classes of building blocks to develop GRACeFUL Concept Maps (GCM),
  * manual selection and instantiation of classes from the library, 
  * send input model to the CFP platform solver,
  * obtain results from the solver.

* T3.4 Interactivity & Usability
  * GUI to visually interact with the libray to add, delete, edit the individual classes to construct the model,
  * obtain input from the stakeholders to evaluate the model,
  * visually represent the results to end-users,
  * option to save and load a model.

This resulted in one deliverable which was handed in on time:
* D3.3 VA EDA Tool Prototype (RAT components)
