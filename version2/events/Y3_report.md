# Fraunhofer IAIS GRACeFUL Year 3 report (2017-02 / 2018-02)

By Dileep Ramachandrarao Krishna Murthy and Steffen Lohmann, 2018-02-14


## Technical achievements w.r.t WP3 objectives and tasks

Fraunhofer IAIS has mainly worked on T3.3 and T3.4 of WP3 on VISUALIZATION & INTERACTION for RAPID ASSESSMENT TOOLS.

* T3.3 Visual model building tool support 
  * obtain a generic library from the DSL prototyping activities (WP4), which contains the classes of building blocks to develop GRACeFUL Concept Maps (GCM);
  * manual selection and instantiation of classes from the library; 
  * send input model to the CFP platform solver;
  * obtain results from the solver.

* T3.4 Interactivity & usability
  * GUI to visually interact with the libray to add, delete, and edit the individual classes to construct the model;
  * obtain input from the stakeholders to evaluate the model;
  * visually represent the results to the end-users;
  * implementation of a feature to save and load a model.

This resulted in one deliverable which was handed in on time:
* D3.3 VA EDA Tool Prototype (RAT components)

The source code of the Graceful Visual Editor is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/GRACeFUL-project/GRACeFULEditor/). 
The tool demo is available online running on a [demo server](http://vocol.iais.fraunhofer.de/graceful-rat/static/index.html)
